        <span class="first-letter">I</span> studied early childhood education
        and worked in the field in 3 different countries. I enjoyed my
        experience of working with children and collaborating with amazing
        people from diverse cultural backgrounds. I returned to Canada in 2020,
        and due to covid, I had to stay home for a while. During that time, I
        tried to learn new things online and came across a free online course
        for web development. I loved the process of thinking logically and
        analyzing and solving problems during that period.

        After completing the course, I felt I’m ready for some change and
        challenge in my life. So, I applied to the CPA program the following
        fall.

        For the past 2 years, I have learned the fundamentals of various
        programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. During
        my studies, I learned the importance of being disciplined and ensuring
        my work was to a high standard. Therefore, I managed to maintain a 4.0
        GPA and even support a couple of my classmates to achieve the same goal
        by tutoring them.

        I have built various projects not only for school, but also on my spare
        time. By accessing them, you can simply click the project button on the

        Since enrolling in the CPA program, my passion for coding has increased
        daily. I see myself improving over time, from someone who had no idea
        what data types are to using complex algorism to solve problems. Coding
        helps me strengthen my analytical and logical skills and teamwork and
        communication skills.

          The two years of the Computer Programming and Analysis program, which
          incorporates group work and lab practices, have provided me with a
          solid foundation in <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>,
          <em>C++</em>, <em>C#</em>, <em>PHP</em> and <em>SQL</em>. The
          experiences of working with my peers to simulate the
          <em>software development life cycle</em> by designing, developing, and
          debugging applications, have equipped me to<em>think logically</em>
          and <em>analyze</em> and <em>solve problems</em> efficiently.
